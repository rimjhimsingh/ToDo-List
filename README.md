# React To-Do List App

This project is a simple to-do list application built with React. It allows users to add items to a list, displaying them in a dynamically updated list. I completed this project to solidify the fundamentals of React, including states, component-based architecture, and event handling.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. This project uses functional components and React hooks.
- **useState**: A Hook that lets you add React state to function components.
- **Event Handling**: React's synthetic events for handling user input and form submissions.

## Key Concepts

- **Functional Components**: The app is built using functional components, which are simpler and recommended for most components unless you need more complex features like lifecycle methods.
- **React Hooks**: Specifically, `useState` is used to handle the app's state management for the input field and the list of to-do items.
- **Event Handling**: Handling user input and button click events to update the state.

## Project Structure

- `App.js`: This is the main component that holds all the logic and rendering of the to-do list.
- `index.js`: The entry point for the React application which renders the `App` component.
- `styles.css`: Contains the styles for the application.
